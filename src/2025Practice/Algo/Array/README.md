### When arrays are slow

## Big O of arrays

- insertion - It depends
- removal - it depends
- searching - O(n)
- Access - O(1)

### Big O of array operations

- push ---------------- O(1)
- pop ----------------- O(1)
- shift --------------- O(N)
- unshift ------------- O(N)
- concat -------------- O(N)
- slice --------------- O(N)
- splice--------------- O(N)
- sort--------------- O(N \* log N)
- forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc. -O(N)

## problem solving steps

1. Can i restate the problem
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
4. can the outputs be determine from the inputs ? Or do I have the enough info to solve the problem
5. How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

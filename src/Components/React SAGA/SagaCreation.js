/* How do you set up and configure Redux Saga in a React application?
A10. To set up and configure Redux Saga in a React application, follow these steps:

Install dependencies: Install Redux, React-Redux, and Redux-Saga using npm or yarn:

npm install --save redux react-redux redux-saga

Create store: Create a Redux store by importing createStore, applyMiddleware from Redux, and createSagaMiddleware from Redux-Saga. Then, create an instance of the saga middleware and pass it to applyMiddleware.

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';

import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga';

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware));

Create root reducer: Combine your application reducers using combineReducers from Redux.

import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

import yourReducer from './yourReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({

yourReducer,

});

Create root saga: Combine your application sagas using all and fork from Redux-Saga.

javascript

Copy code

import { all, fork } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import yourSaga from './yourSaga';

function* rootSaga() {

yield all([fork(yourSaga)]);
a
}

Run the root saga: Use the run method of the saga middleware instance to run the root saga.

sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);

Connect the store: Use the Provider component from React-Redux to connect the Redux store to your React application.

import React from 'react';

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

import App from './App';

const Root = () => (

<Provider store={store}>

<App />

</Provider>

);

export default Root; */
